          <h3>My Mission Statement</h3>
          <p>
            I believe that the world is changing fast when moving on to the idea of AI and using it efficiently. With AI it is the idea of making everyday life easier and more efficient than it already is, I would love to take part in the project of helping others with AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why I am studying computer science and engineering; there are many ways that learning computer science can help with the development of AI and make it more known and usable. I know that AI will soon
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not doing computer science, I am trying to learn everything I can before I get into college so I just know the most I can and be at my potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current skill I am trying to learn is photography because I want to be able to become unique with it, also while being creative and eventually being able to make money off of this passion.

          <h3>Post Graduation Plans</h3>
          <p>
            After graduation, I hope to go to college to study computer science.   My top choice schools are Univerity of Texas at Dallas(UTD) University of North Texas(UNT) and Texas A&M. I am applying to schools that have a good curriculium in computer science and that I can have a good chance to make good connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The job I would love to do is to become a computer scientest or software engineer that deals with the development of AI, becuase you would be able to make a lot of money from it, but I could also see it being fun, as you are able to be creative. My dream job would be to become a video game streamer or an NFL or NBA player as I would have the most fun while making tons of money.
